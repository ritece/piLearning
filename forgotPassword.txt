I had forgotten my password to ssh to the pi, so to reset the same I found several instructions on the internet.

Following instructions from the link -https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2014/08/how-to-reset-a-forgotten-raspberry-pi-password/

worked for me.

Steps :

1. First power off the pi and remove the sd card.
2. Insert the sd card on your pc. I have a ubuntu. So, for ubuntu when I plugged  it in, it showed two directories, boot and root. 
3. The boot partition has a file named - "cmdline.txt" and this has to be edited for the purpose. 
4. To mount the boot and root directories, i followed instructions from - 
https://books.google.co.in/books?id=pdWQAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA6&lpg=PA6&dq=mount+mmcblk0+raspberry&source=bl&ots=8rvr5LslWU&sig=UjdmIf5JMo8e4LJwsUkHmvD9bmI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjJ9-3I1c7WAhULPY8KHRahBVEQ6AEINzAD#v=onepage&q=mount%20mmcblk0%20raspberry&f=false

5. With root permissions, mount the two boot and root partitions.
	In the instructions, they made two directories in the /mnt/ path.
	"mkdir /mnt/raspi-boot" and "mkdir /mnt/raspi-root".

6. Now, the actual mount command, "mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt/raspi-boot"
   and "mout /dev/mmcblk0p2 /mnt/raspi-root".

7. There should be no errors when these two commands are run.

8. Now, go to raspi-boot and edit the file mentioned above. "cd /mnt/raspi-boot"

9. run the command on terminal "vi cmdline.txt"

10. run the command on terminal "sync"

11. Unmount the two partitions using , "umount /mnt/raspi-boot" and "umount /mnt/raspi-root"

12. Now, eject the sd card.

13. Plug the sd card back into the pi, and power it on.

14. The shell will show. Now, run the command "mount -rw -o remount /"

15. I had not run the above command, so it was not accepting my new password.	

16. Now, run the command to change the password - "passwd pi"

17. Follow the instructions as they appear.

18. run the command "sync"

19. run the command "exec /sbin/init"

20. Pi now booted up and showed the desktop.



But there was a problem, since the cmdline.txt file was edited, the changes that were made need to be reverted.


So, i plugged the sd card back into my pc and then mounted the paritions again and tried to edit the file. But, it was not allowing me to write the file now.


I put the sd card back again into the pi after safe unmount.

On the shell, i ran the "exec /sbin/init" command, it presented the desktop to me.

Now i used the pi's terminal and navigated to the /boot/ directory and then reverted the changes made in the "cmdline.txt" file with root permissions.
