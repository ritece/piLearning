I have connected the pi to the TV via an HDMI cable.


There was no sound coming from the pi when I played anything.


I searched for the solution and found this link - 

https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/32971/raspbian-no-audio-hdmi-have-tried-all-the-troubleshooting-i-can-find/56674#56674?newreg=4542b50a5425468d9c8ff42691555d14


This link asks to edit the config.txt file found in the boot partition.

Go to /boot/ directory. And use you favorite editor (vi etc.) to remove the "#" symbol if it is there from the line which says - hdmi_drive=2

Reboo the pi, with command "sudo reboot"

Pi will reboot and then play sound to check if it works. (it worked for me)
